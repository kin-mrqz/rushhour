### Game Description and Rules: 

*Hungry Hour* is a strategic puzzle game based on the traditional mechanics of the Rush Hour board game, but with a delightful twist. In this game, players must help the smiley face ðŸ˜€, known as James, navigate through a gridlocked board to reach the far right exit. The board is cluttered with various cars, each represented by colorful blocks that can only move horizontally/vertically in line with their orientation. 

Your task is to devise a path for James by using simple commands to move coloured cars left-right or up-down, and move James to its destination - the far right exit. Cars come in multiple colors including Red ðŸŸ¥, Orange ðŸŸ§, Purple ðŸŸª, and others, each designated by a unique letter for easy command input. You cannot go through cars if they are in the way. Remember, James can only move horizontally. 

Examples of commands: 
* 'j r 4': move **James**, **4** blocks to the **right**.
* 'o u 2': move **Orange car**, **2** blocks **up**.
* 'r d 1': move **Red car**, **1** blocks **down**.
* 'w l 3': move **White car**, **3** blocks **left**.

Earn more points by winning each round quicker! Points depend on how quick you solve the round and how many moves you use, the max being 1000 points. You can exit the game at any moment by pressing 'q'. Plan your moves carefully and lead James to victory in this engaging puzzle challenge!
